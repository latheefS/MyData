- Straightening of cervical spine - Possibly due to Spasm.
- Small osteophytes noted in the cervical spine.
- Degenerative changes in the C5-C6 cervical intervertebral discs in the form of loss of normal T2 bright signal.
- Disc protrusion with annular tear at C5-C6 level causing indentation over thecal sac, bilateral neural recess 
narrowing with bilateral neural compromise.
- Disc bulges at C4-C5 and C6-C7 levels with annular tear at C6-C7 level causing indentation over thecal sac, 
bilateral neural recess narrowing with bilateral neural compromise, more so at C6-C7 level.

- Small osteophytes noted in dorsal spine.
- Mild disc bulges at D6-D7,D8-D9 and D9-D10 levels causing indentation over thecal sac, bilateral neural recess 
narrowing with bilateral mild neural compromise at D9-D10 level.
- Mild Focal ligamentum flavum hypertrophy at D10-D11 level causing posterior indentation of thecal sac.


- Small osteophytes noted in the lumbar spine.
- Degenerative changes in the L4-L5 lumbar intervertebral disc in the form of loss of normal T2 bright signal.
- Disc bulges with annular tear at L4-L5 and L5-S1 levels causing indentation over thecal sac, bilateral neural 
recess narrowing with bilateral neural compromise, more so at L4-L5 level.


- Complex meniscal tear involving posterior horn of medial meniscus.
- Fluid collection in suprapatellar recess and tibiofemoral joint space.

- Horizontal tear involving posterior horn of medial meniscus.
- Fluid collection in suprapatellar recess and tibiofemoral joint space.
